<div class="two-third-col">
  <p>Dictionaries are used to <a href="/webeditor.html#annotation-types">normalize entities</a>. This is the format of dictionary files used at tagtog.</p>
  <p>The dictionary file to upload must be a <code>.tsv</code> file (tab-separated values) (or a compressed <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> containing a single <code>.tsv</code>). To upload dictionary files visit <i>Settings > Dictionaries</i>.</p>
  <p>The dictionary format should follow this pattern:</p>

  <div markdown="1">
  ```
  entity_1_id    recname1    recname2    ...
  entity_2_id    recname1    recname2    @@@    altname1    altname2    ...
  ...
  ```  
</div>


</div>
<div class="one-third-col">
  {% capture version %}<strong>Version</strong>: <code>{{ page.version }}</code>{% endcapture %}
  {% include message.html message=version %}
  {% include message.html message="Spreadsheet software is a good choice to manipulate <code>TSV</code> files" %}
</div>


<div class="two-third-col">
  <p>The syntax is simple:</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>Each entity is defined in a new line. All columns are separated by tabs.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>The first column is the entity's <strong>unique id</strong>. It can be an internal id (e.g. your database) or recognized (using known sources as Wikipedia).</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-3"></span>After the id, a list of names follows. These are considered different names (synonyms) of the entity.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-4"></span>You can define <strong>recommended names</strong> and, optionally, <strong>alternative names</strong>. At least one recommended name must be given. Alternative names are those placed after the special delimiter <code>@@@</code> (also separated within tabs). Use them when you know that some names appear less frequently than the standard ones. With this information, the system can handle synonyms better.</p>

<div class="one-third-col">
  {% include message.html message="<strong>Note</strong>: the id is not considered a name. If you want it to be a name, put it in the list of names. Only in the basic case where the entity has 1 sole name and this matches the id, the name can be omitted and is therefore defined implicitly." %}
  {% include message.html message="The ids in a dictionary cannot contain spaces and must match the regular expression: <code>^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-:\.\@]+$ </code>" %}
  {% include message.html message="<strong>Note</strong>: the names must NOT be tokenized." %}
