  <p>tagtog is a multi-user tool. Collaborate with other users to annotate faster and improve the quality of your annotations.</p>
  <p>It supports different roles as annotator. Each user can annotate their own copy of the text, facilitating the review process and measurement of inter-annotator agreement (IAA).</p>

  <h2>Annotation versions</h2>
  <p><strong>Each user has an independent version of the annotations for each single document</strong>. For instance, UserA could have 20 entities; UserB could have 5 different entities on the same exact document. <strong>In addition, each document has a <code>master</code> version</strong> which is usually treated as the final/official version.</p>

<div class="two-third-col">
  <h2>Annotation flows</h2>
  <p>There are different ways you can organize your annotation tasks. These are the most common:</p>
  <br/>
  <h4>Each annotator annotates each document</h4>
  <p>This flow is ideal for those projects requiring high-quality annotations and complex annotation tasks (specific skills required, divergent interpretations, etc.).</p>
