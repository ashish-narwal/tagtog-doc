You can import CSV (comma-separated values) and TSV (tab-separated values) files onto tagtog ðŸ˜». This also means, you can easily **import any excel sheet** onto tagtog ðŸ“Š.

### How it's parsed

An imported file is parsed as follows:

* **The first row is considered the header**. Each column represents a section in tagtog, and the header gives the title for each.
* **Each subsequent row represents a document**. Each column represents a paragraph in a section in tagtog, whose header is given by the corresponding header column. Content rows with a different number of columns than the header's are allowed. In case the row has less columns, everything remains equal. If the row has more columns than the header's, then a stub title for the column section is created with the pattern: `"Column-#{columnNumber}"`.

_Note_: the imported file has _at least_ 2 rows: 1 for the header, the other for the first document. Each subsequent row is another document.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like to upload a csv file and have it uploaded all as a single document on tagtog? ðŸ¤” [Contact us](https://www.tagtog.net/#contact) and we can implement it.

#### Example

How the parsing works is best explained with an example ðŸ™‚. Say you start with an excel file (or numbers file on macOS) like the following:

<img src="assets/img/csv/example_excel.png" alt="Example excel" width="40%"/>

<br/>
You can save the file as CSV:

<img src="assets/img/csv/save_as_csv.png" alt="Save as CSV" width="40%"/>

<br/>
The file will look like this on a text editor:

```
Header Section 1,Header Section 2
doc1 - section 1,doc1 - section 2
doc2 - section 1,doc2 - section 2
```

<br/>
Uploading that CSV file, will result in two documents on tagtog:

<img src="assets/img/csv/2_parsed_documents.png" alt="Save as CSV" width="100%"/>

<br/>
And, for example, the document 1 will look like this (note the headers in bold and the paragraphs in regular font):

<img src="assets/img/csv/document1.png" alt="Save as CSV" width="60%"/>
