    <h1>Welcome to tagtog</h1>
    <p>This is the official documentation for {% include inline-image.html name="icon_leafs.png" width="18" %}<a href="https://www.tagtog.net" title="tagtog.net - the text annotation tool to train AI">tagtog</a>, an efficient text annotation tool ready to train AI. Served on the cloud or on-premises. <strong>Easy</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Annotate manually or automatically</strong>. Use already trained machine learning models or train your own model to annotate and work at scale. Simply annotate manually and tagtog will generate a model with no hassle in deployment or maintenance. Save time and costs.</p>
    <p>Invite others to annotate in your projects and <strong>collaborate</strong> to build together awesome stuff: find custom insights in text automatically, augment or index your data, train your own AI, classify text, etc.</p>
    <p>Below are some things you can with tagtog. For more in-depth information or tutorials, use the navigation to the left to explore our documentation.</p>

    <h2>What can you achieve?</h2>
    <div class="page-section">
      <h3>Manual text annotation</h3>
      <p>Use the text annotation editor to quickly annotate and normalize entities, relations and <a title="tagtog-docs: type of annotations" href="/webeditor.html#annotation-types">more</a>. If you just need to annotate at document level, you can use labels to tag documents. The <strong>user interface adapts automatically so you only see what you need</strong>. No more complex or non-intuitive annotating systems/interfaces, engage your domain experts from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>Too much work for a single person? <a href="#team-collaboration">Invite others and work in group</a>. Each annotator can annotate the same text to facilitate the review process. Once the annotations are completed, you can export them to JSON format.</p>
      {% include image.html name="annotation_editor.png" caption="Named Entity Recognition with tagtog annotation editor" %}
      <p>Not fast enough? Use automatic annotations to speed up annotator tasks. Use trained models or customize your own. Users will see the automatic annotations and just make an action when predictions are wrong. Powered by <strong>NLP</strong> and <strong>active learning</strong> algorithms, tagtog uses the corrections to improve accuracy and <strong>continuously reduce the load of annotators' work</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Get relevant insights from text automatically</h3>
        <p>Insights are just meta information (annotations) on the top of the text analyzed. You can either combine some of our <a href="#pre-trained-models">already trained machine learning models</a> or create a custom model adapted to your problem to automatically generate this meta-information without the hassle of deployments, setup, etc. Just annotate, you donâ€™t need to code, deal with complex installations or juggle with data.</p>

      <h2>NLP annotation editor</h2>
      <div class="two-third-col">
        <p>tagtog comes with an advanced text annotation tool for <strong>data augmentation</strong>. Its design is based on the feedback from annotator groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Focus</strong> is key in order to generate a high-quality annotated corpora, and we know this. Each single mistake in the annotations means a step backward and more effort to achieve the desired results. With this in mind and to make the user feel comfortable while reading, we have created a <strong>minimalist user interface</strong> where the text is presented with natural spacing, same as any user can be familiar with. By <strong>protecting the reading experience</strong> the tool is more accessible. This is specially important when you involve subject matter experts in your annotation projects.</p>
        <p>Usually annotation tasks involve dealing with big volumes of texts. <strong>Speed and efficiency</strong> are essential to minimize costs and time. tagtog includes features as automatic annotations, overlapping text annotations or full-text annotation, that reduce significantly the time required to annotate text.</p>
        <p>With the annotation editor you can add different types of annotations:</p>

    <h2>Team collaboration</h2>
    <div class="two-third-col">
      <p>Define your annotation <strong>guidelines</strong> within the application and invite others to join your project. A group of users can annotate together the same corpus, <strong>each document or piece of text can be annotated separately by each member</strong> to facilitate the <strong>review</strong> process. You can compare the annotations of each member and use the most convenient. Once annotations are ready, each document can be marked as completed to make other team members aware that it is ready for review. There is an <a href="/collaboration.html#roles">admin role</a> with privileges to manage annotators' work.</p>
      <p>It is easier than ever to collaborate and train machine learning models together. Each time a document is marked as completed, a model is being trained automatically and can be used right away. You can of course use the tool only for manual annotation.</p>

For example, if you have trained a model that has extracted skills in thousands of CVs, those got indexed and you can search across them using normalizations, entity classes, etc. You can do things like: <code>entity:softskill:time-management</code> to retrieve all CVs from people who are good organizing their work time.</p>
